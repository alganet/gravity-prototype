; Pre-Module Graph
;
; These containers will be merged before any other. Their instances will
; be available to all other containers, including vendors.
;;
  ; Loads global variables (connection/server settings, etc)
    pre[] = etc/variables.ini
  ; Loads datasources (connection instances, mappers, naming convention)
    pre[] = etc/datasources.ini

;;
; Clustered Graph
;
; These keys will be shared and merged across all containers. It allows
; collecting instances from several different packages and vendors by using
; a conventional name.
;;
  ; Cluster routes from all containers.
    clustered[]   = routes
    routes[]      = [catalogHomeRoute]
    routes[]      = [gravityHomeRoute]

  ; Cluster datasource collections from all containers.
    clustered[]   = collections
    collections[] = [products, [catalogProductsCollection]]

  ; Cluster schema contributions from all containers.
    clustered[]   = schemas
    schemas[]     = [defaultSchema]
    schemas[]     = [localeSchema]
    schemas[]     = [catalogProductsSchema]
